\begin{abstract}
    Photography quality of cell phones has received lot of attention. Due to physical
    limitation on small lens and COMS censor, digital images captured by even high-ending
    cell phones are easily suffer from noise on low illuminated areas, or unable to capture
    dynamic range on highly exposed areas. One possible solution is taking a burst of frames with different
    exposure and ISOs, then merging this burst into single high quality image.
    This rises the challenge of effectively align these frames before or after a series
    of other sophisticated operations be performed. 
    We try to address this challenge on this course project.
